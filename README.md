littlehelper
============

This will be a repository where I will place little helpers for programing in C. 

Usually the files do not need any specific libraries or anything else, just add them to your main.c




1. What is inttochar.h
A file with two functions. The first one is there to convert integers up to 9999 to chars.
The second function can replace strings with other strings in strings ....
